        <p class="text-center averia greentwo">Hypertufa is a material made from cement, peat moss, sand, perlite and/or vermiculite. It is ideal for garden containers because it gives the look and feel of stone without the weight. In addition to being light-weight, it is extremely durable in all seasons and can be made in a variety of textures and natural colors.</p>
